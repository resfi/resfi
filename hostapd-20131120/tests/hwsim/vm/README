These scripts allow you to run the hwsim tests inside a KVM virtual machine.

To set it up, first compile a kernel with the kernel-config file as the
.config. You can adjust it as needed, the configuration is for a 64-bit
x86 system and should be close to minimal. The architecture must be the
same as your host since the host's filesystem is used.

Install the required tools: at least 'kvm', if you want tracing trace-cmd,
valgrind if you want, etc.

Compile the hwsim tests as per the instructions given, you may have to
install some extra development packages (e.g. binutils-dev for libbfd).

Create a vm-config file and put the KERNELDIR option into it (see the
vm-run.sh script). If you want valgrind, also increase the memory size.

Now you can run the vm-run.sh script and it will execute the tests using
your system's root filesystem (read-only) inside the VM. The options you
give it are passed through to run-all.sh, see there.
